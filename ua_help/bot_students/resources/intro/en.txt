We are volunteers of the Educational Bridge project, which is aimed at providing educational support to Ukrainian schoolchildren during this difficult time. Among us are teachers, tutors and simply caring people who are ready to conduct free distance individual and group classes with schoolchildren in all subjects, including classes aimed at preparing for such exams as ZNO, Unified State Examination, etc.
